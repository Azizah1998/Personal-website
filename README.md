<h1>~My Daily Routine During MCO~</h1>
<p>Assalamualaikum and Hi! My name is Azizah and I am going to tell you
what am I doing during this MCO. So, during this Movement Control Order,
instead of going back home, I spent my time in hostel.</p>

<p>So, basically in the early of the MCO, my friends and I had lots of free time
One thing we did the most during MCO was browsing through social media. I enjoyed watching videos
in youtube. I's spent up 3 hours straight doing social media thing because we were too bored that time.</p>

<p> As far as I remember, we didn't have that much work to do early of the MCO. What we did was, We did some
exploration with our subject. This is because we are still not very familiar with the subject and syllibus
We also did our assignment, as all of the lectures and work were given online and we were asked to use certain
platform such as, Google classroom, WhatsApp, I-learn and so on as mean of our communication with lecturers.
We were just about to enter week 4 when we were ask to go back home due to the covid-19 pandemic. It is going
to be a memorable experience though.</p>

<p> Me and my roommate, we did our routine exercise. It is just a light exercise for the sake of breaking our
sweat. We did a 30 minutes zumba dance to our all time favorite KPOP song. It was very fun if you are so in
to it. We did that every evening at 4:00PM or 5:00PM during this MCO.</p>

<p> I am feeling so grateful as UiTM took a very good care of us, mainly for those who are staying in college
dusing this MCO. Our welfare as a student are much being prioritized. UiTM gave us free food everyday including
for our breakfast, lunch and dinner. They also try their best to provide other things that we need. Therefore
we feel very thankful and grateful even we couldn't make it to go back home to our family</p>
