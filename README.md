<h1>~My Daily Routine During MCO~</h1>
<p>Assalamualaikum and Hi! My name is Azizah and I am going to tell you<br>
what am I doing during this MCO. So, during this Movement Control Order,<br>
instead of going back home, I spent my time in hostel.</p> </br>

<p><center> So, basically in the early of the MCO, my friends and I had lots of free time<br>
One thing we did the most during MCO was browsing through social media. I enjoyed watching videos<br>
in youtube. I's spent up 3 hours straight doing social media thing because we were too bored that time.<br>

<p> As far as I remember, we didn't have that much work to do early of the MCO. What we did was, We did some<br>
exploration with our subject. This is because we are still not very familiar with the subject and syllibus<br>
We also did our assignment, as all of the lectures and work were given online and we were asked to use certain<br>
platform such as, Google classroom, WhatsApp, I-learn and so on as mean of our communication with lecturers.<br>
We were just about to enter week 4 when we were ask to go back home due to the covid-19 pandemic. It is going<br>
to be a memorable experience though.<br>

<p> Me and my roommate, we did our routine exercise. It is just a light exercise for the sake of breaking our<br>
sweat. We did a 30 minutes zumba dance to our all time favorite KPOP song. It was very fun if you are so in<br>
to it. We did that every evening at 4:00PM or 5:00PM during this MCO.<br>

<p> I am feeling so grateful as UiTM took a very good care of us, mainly for those who are staying in college<br>
dusing this MCO. Our welfare as a student are much being prioritized. UiTM gave us free food everyday including<br>
for our breakfast, lunch and dinner. They also try their best to provide other things that we need. Therefore<br>
we feel very thankful and grateful even we couldn't make it to go back home to our family<br>
